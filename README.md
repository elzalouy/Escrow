# EcrowBchain

Escrowbchain is a mobile app that aims to digitalize the escrow payments between buyers
and suppliers and it’s replacing the banks’ escrow and LC Services. After an agreement
is reached between the buyer and the supplier, the buyer issues a Work Package on
escrowBchain application reflecting the terms of the agreement, milestones and
payments’ schedule. Once the supplier accepts these terms, this becomes a registered
and protected smart contract. The next step is for the buyer to deposit the contract value
into an escrow account and the Work Package is activated. Once the product or service
is delivered, and the buyer accepts, money is automatically transferred to the supplier.
### Responsibility
I was responsible for maintaining, refactoring, and Developing the last version of the application to be suitable for the business needs.
The application is under development for now.
